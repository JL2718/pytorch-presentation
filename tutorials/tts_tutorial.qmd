# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use `torchaudio` to convert text to speech (TTS). `torchaudio` is a PyTorch library that provides audio processing capabilities, including TTS models. We will use a pre-trained TTS model to synthesize speech from text.

# Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Torchaudio
- Quarto

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio
```

# Step 1: Import Required Libraries

First, let's import the necessary libraries. We will use `torchaudio` for TTS and `IPython.display` to play the generated audio.

```python
import torch
import torchaudio
from IPython.display import Audio
```

# Step 2: Load a Pre-trained TTS Model

Torchaudio provides several pre-trained TTS models. For this tutorial, we will use the Tacotron 2 model, which is a popular TTS model.

```python
# Load the Tacotron 2 model
tts_model, example_text = torchaudio.load_text_to_speech_model("tacotron2")
```

# Step 3: Prepare the Input Text

Next, we need to prepare the input text that we want to convert to speech. The input text should be a string.

```python
# Input text
text = "Hello, this is a demonstration of text to speech using Torchaudio."
```

# Step 4: Generate Mel Spectrogram

The Tacotron 2 model generates a mel spectrogram from the input text. We will use the model to generate this spectrogram.

```python
# Generate mel spectrogram
spectrogram = tts_model.generate_spectrogram(text)
```

# Step 5: Convert Mel Spectrogram to Audio

Once we have the mel spectrogram, we can convert it to an audio waveform using a vocoder. Torchaudio provides a pre-trained WaveGlow vocoder, which we will use here.

```python
# Load the WaveGlow vocoder
vocoder = torchaudio.load_vocoder("waveglow")

# Convert mel spectrogram to audio waveform
waveform = vocoder(spectrogram)
```

# Step 6: Play the Generated Audio

Finally, we can play the generated audio using `IPython.display.Audio`.

```python
# Play the audio
Audio(waveform.numpy(), rate=22050)
```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use `torchaudio` to convert text to speech. We loaded a pre-trained Tacotron 2 model, generated a mel spectrogram from text, and then converted the spectrogram to an audio waveform using a WaveGlow vocoder. The generated audio was played using `IPython.display.Audio`.

You can now experiment with different texts and models to create your own TTS applications.
