- **2018**: PyTorch 1.0 was released, introducing significant improvements and integrating with Caffe2, another deep learning framework developed by Facebook.
- **2020**: PyTorch 1.5 was released, featuring enhanced support for distributed training, better integration with cloud platforms, and improved performance.
- **2021**: PyTorch 1.10 and 1.11 were released, continuing to expand its capabilities and ecosystem.

### Employee Count

As of 2023, the exact number of employees dedicated to PyTorch development is not publicly disclosed. However, it is known that the PyTorch team is part of Meta's larger AI Research and Engineering organization, which includes hundreds of researchers, engineers, and support staff.

### Research Activities

PyTorch is deeply integrated with the research community. It is widely used in academic research, with many papers and projects being developed using PyTorch. The framework is known for its dynamic computation graph, which allows for more flexible and intuitive model development compared to static graph frameworks like TensorFlow.
